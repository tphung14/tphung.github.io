## Data Analysis of Steam(PC) Player Counts by Genres 
### Description

To figure out which video game genres that players are more interested in to give an idea for developers which genre they should choose. My solution is to pick a genre that appears to have a healthy amount of average and peak players that are interested in the genre.

### Data Collection 
Datasets are obtained from the website Kaggle - a community of data scientists that publishes datasets to use.
I only needed to make a free account to obtain these relevant datasets to use.
