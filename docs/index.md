## Data Analysis of Steam(PC) Player Counts by Genres 
### Description

To figure out which video game genres that players are more interested in to give an idea for developers which genre they should choose. My solution is to pick a genre that appears to have a healthy amount of average and peak players that are interested in the genre.

### Data Collection 
Datasets are obtained from the website Kaggle - a community of data scientists that publishes datasets to use.
I only needed to make a free account to obtain these relevant datasets to use.

### Analysis
Analyzed the total average/peak players and the average/peak players over months(from 2012 to 2021)in Steam in 8 different genres:
```
Action- Emphasizes physical challenges and battling enemies with weapons/tools.
Adventure- Emphasizes a story focused approach driven by exploration and puzzle solving.
Other- Games that don't neatly fit into other genres - usually experimental indie games.
RPG- Emphasizes character development of a single or multiple player controlled characters in a immersive world.
Racing- Emphasizes racing competitions in real or fictional worlds.
Simulation- Video games that attempt to closely mirror real life activities.
Sports- Emphasizes the practice of sports.
Strategy- Emphasizes planning and managing a group in a usually non-first person setting.
```
